## FAQs
### Why is my resume not showing up when I search username.github.io?

Your resume not showing up may be due to the fact that your repository name is not the same as your username for Github. To fix this, you can change your repository name to match your username. Another common issue is if you have not changed your resume markdown file to index.md. Alternatively, you may have tried to open your resume before the website has finished building. If this is the case, a solution is to check the actions tab and the progress of building the static website is stated. If you see a green dot, then the process has finished and your resume is available to be read.

### Why is Markdown better than Word Processor
Markdown is better than word processor because it creates documentation in a flexible way, being able to be opened using any application compared to Word Processor that needs to be opened as a PDF. PDFs are more suited for short term use. Documentation is more suited towards living online and thus would use Markdown over PDF as Markdown is highly portable compared to Word.
